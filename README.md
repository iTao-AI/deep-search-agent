# Decision Research Agent

An evidence-driven research agent that gathers source-backed findings and turns them into decision-ready briefs. Built on LangGraph / DeepAgents, it combines autonomous planning, delegated research, auditable evidence capture, run-scoped persistence, and deterministic delivery contracts.

The canonical repository and technical identity are `decision-research-agent`.
The exact `/health` service value and legacy configuration aliases remain
`deep-search-agent` for bounded compatibility.

**Data flow:**
1. User submits a question via REST API or WebSocket
2. Main Agent analyzes the question and creates an execution plan
3. Specialized sub-agents are dispatched with isolated contexts
4. Results are synthesized into Markdown/PDF reports
5. Progress is available through run-scoped API and WebSocket consumers

## Key Engineering Decisions

### ContextVar Session Isolation

Concurrent API requests share the same Python process. Without isolation, global state (current thread_id, workspace path, LLM callbacks) would bleed between requests. We use `contextvars.ContextVar` to attach session-scoped state to each async task, ensuring request A's workspace never touches request B's files.

See: [`api/context.py`](api/context.py)

### YAML Prompt Configuration

Agent system prompts live in `prompt/prompts.yml` instead of Python string literals. This separates prompt content from code, enables version-controlled prompt iteration without touching Python files, and allows non-developers to review/edit prompts.

### WebSocket over Polling

The agent execution produces many intermediate events (tool calls, sub-agent dispatches, reasoning steps). Polling would waste bandwidth and introduce latency. WebSocket pushes each event as it happens, giving first-party tools or future UI consumers real-time visibility into the agent's planning process.

### Retry, Timeout, Cache, Token Tracking

Tavily and RAGFlow calls are wrapped with timeout policies and retry decorators with exponential backoff. MySQL connections use connect_timeout and read_timeout. Tavily search results use TTL caching (300s). Token tracking via LangChain `BaseCallbackHandler` records input/output/total tokens per LLM call with cost estimation. These make the system observable and resilient to transient failures.

See: [`tools/cache.py`](tools/cache.py), [`agent/token_tracking.py`](agent/token_tracking.py), [`tools/retry_utils.py`](tools/retry_utils.py)

### Upload/Download Path Security

File uploads use filename sanitization (strip directory components, Windows path handling) and length validation. Download paths are resolved through a virtual-path cleaning mechanism that prevents `../` traversal, limiting the risk of out-of-bounds file access.

See: [`api/upload_security.py`](api/upload_security.py), [`utils/path_utils.py`](utils/path_utils.py)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- Tavily API key
- DeepSeek API key

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Start the backend
python api/server.py

```

API endpoints:
- **POST /api/task** — Start an agent task
- **POST /api/upload** — Upload files for analysis
- **GET /api/files** — List generated files
- **GET /api/download** — Download generated files
- **GET /api/tasks/{thread_id}** — View persisted task status and output path
- **GET /api/token-usage/{thread_id}** — View token usage for a thread
- **GET /api/research/runs/{thread_id}** — View ResearchRun and EvidenceLedger for a thread
- **GET /api/research/runs** — List recent ResearchRun records
- **POST /api/runs** / **GET /api/runs/{run_id}** — Start and inspect isolated research runs
- **GET /api/reviews** / **GET /api/reviews/health** — Authenticated controlled review queue and runtime readiness
- **GET /api/runs/{run_id}/reviews/{review_id}** — Authenticated immutable review detail
- **POST /api/runs/{run_id}/reviews/{review_id}/decisions** — Authenticated approve/reject decision
- **GET /api/runs/{run_id}/evidence/verifications** — Authenticated, paginated effective Evidence verification state
- **POST /api/runs/{run_id}/evidence/verification-snapshots** — Finalize a revisioned verification snapshot and publication
- **GET /api/telemetry/runs/{run_id}** / **GET /api/token-usage/runs/{run_id}** — View run-scoped observability
- **WebSocket /ws/runs/{run_id}** — Run-scoped real-time event stream
- **WebSocket /ws/{thread_id}** — Real-time reasoning stream

WebSocket events: `session_created`, `tool_start`, `assistant_call`, `task_result`, `task_finalized`, `run_timeout`, `error`

### Talent Benchmark Fixtures

Talent runs can preload server-bundled `provided_aggregate` fixtures without
giving the model filesystem, upload, or runtime search-tool access. The provider
is disabled by default and only resolves aggregate IDs declared in a validated
`ResearchScope`.

```bash
export DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_ENABLE_BENCHMARK_FIXTURES=true

# Example fixture and matching scope:
# benchmarks/fixtures/talent-hiring-signal-v1.json
# benchmarks/talent-hiring-signal-v1/research-scope.json
```

The provider never accepts caller-controlled paths. Keep it disabled outside
explicit benchmark or development runs. The Talent model cites declared sample
IDs or source URLs; the service normalizes those aliases to run-scoped evidence
IDs before review.

### Controlled Durable Review

The bounded P1B review path passed all 13 durability and safety gates, including
container restart and SIGKILL crash windows. P1C adds an authenticated
first-party backend and CLI workflow for list, show, approve, reject, wait, and
doctor operations. The feature remains disabled by default:

```dotenv
DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_ENABLE_DURABLE_HITL=false
```

The supported boundary is one backend replica with persistent, separate
application and checkpoint SQLite databases plus persistent output storage.
No frontend review controls are shipped in this repository. An `approve`
decision permits delivery but does not verify evidence. A `reject` decision
blocks delivery and does not start new research.

See the [controlled review operator guide](docs/operations/controlled-review-workflow.md),
[P1B feasibility notes](docs/operations/durable-hitl-feasibility.md), and
[gate report](docs/evidence/durable-hitl-gate-report.json). A PASS report does
not establish multi-instance, multi-user, or public-internet production
readiness.

### Controlled Evidence Verification

P2A adds append-only human Evidence verification decisions, deterministic
snapshots, revisioned publications, fresh-review enforcement, and canonical
CLI commands. It remains disabled by default:

```dotenv
DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_ENABLE_EVIDENCE_VERIFICATION=false
```

The supported boundary is the existing single-replica SQLite durable review
runtime. It does not add UI, RBAC, automatic source retrieval, LLM verification,
multi-instance operation, runtime Skills, Async Subagents, or real-source
proof. See the [Evidence verification operator guide](docs/operations/evidence-verification-workflow.md).

## Known Boundaries

- **WeasyPrint dependency**: PDF conversion tests require WeasyPrint system libraries (cairo, pango, gobject). On machines with dependencies available, tests run for real. On machines without them, conversion tests are skipped via `pytest.mark.skipif`, and the missing-dependency error path is tested via import-stage `OSError` simulation. Docker 环境已包含这些依赖。
- **API Key auth**: All `/api/*` endpoints are protected by `APIKeyMiddleware`. Requests without `X-API-Key` header get 401. Inject `API_SECRET` through the deployment environment to enable; if unset, a warning is logged but all requests pass through (dev mode).
- **WebSocket auth**: Browser clients pass the key via the `api_key` query parameter because native WebSocket constructors cannot set custom headers. Production logs should avoid recording full WebSocket URLs.
- **Task state persistence**: Tasks are persisted to SQLite (`data/tasks.db`) through `api/persistence.py`. Server restart does not lose completed task records. Query by `GET /api/tasks/{thread_id}`.
- **Research evidence persistence**: Terminal tasks also persist ResearchRun metadata and EvidenceLedger entries. Query by `GET /api/research/runs/{thread_id}`. Evidence entries are source-like observations from tool messages, not independently verified facts.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs backend tests on push/PR to `main`. API keys must be configured in GitHub Secrets.
- **Benchmark data**: A repeated benchmark runner exists at `scripts/benchmark_runner.py`, but new median/P95 numbers should only be reported after a real multi-run benchmark is executed and archived. The existing 5-query data remains a single snapshot.
- **Durable HITL**: P1B durability evidence is PASS and P1C provides a controlled backend/CLI workflow, but the feature remains disabled by default and supported only for a controlled single-node deployment. This repository does not ship frontend review controls.
