# Durable HITL Feasibility

## Status

The endpoint is experimental and disabled by default. A successful gate report
proves the bounded P1B durability contract only; it does not enable the feature
automatically or establish general production readiness.

## Enable in a controlled environment

```dotenv
DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_ENABLE_DURABLE_HITL=true
API_SECRET=<configured out of band>
DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_DB_PATH=/app/data/decision_research_agent.db
DECISION_RESEARCH_AGENT_CHECKPOINT_DB_PATH=/app/data/review_checkpoints.db
```

Both SQLite files must use persistent storage. Keep `API_SECRET` outside source
control and send it through the `X-API-Key` header.

## Decision semantics

- `approve` permits delivery and creates the reviewed DecisionBrief artifact.
  It does not verify evidence or convert candidate claims into verified facts.
- `reject` sets delivery to `blocked`, records the resolution, and does not
  start new research or create a reviewed DecisionBrief artifact.
- A repeated byte-equivalent decision request is an idempotent replay.
  Conflicting decisions fail closed.

## Recovery boundary

The application database is authoritative for the immutable decision, workflow
status, leases, resolution, and artifact metadata. The separate LangGraph
checkpoint database is authoritative only for the pure review-gate execution
checkpoint. Startup reconciliation repairs known crash windows; ambiguous or
poisoned state becomes `manual_recovery` rather than being guessed.

## Gate command

Docker must be running because a skipped container test is a gate failure.

```bash
python scripts/durable_hitl_gate_runner.py \
  --output docs/evidence/durable-hitl-gate-report.json
```

`PASS` requires thirteen passes. Any failure or Docker skip is `NO_GO`. On
`NO_GO`, keep the feature flag false and do not begin P1C.
