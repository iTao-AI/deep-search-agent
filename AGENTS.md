# AGENTS.md

This file defines the execution rules for Codex in this repository.

## Project Purpose

Decision Research Agent is an evidence-driven research service built on
LangGraph and DeepAgents. It turns open-ended questions into source-backed
findings, auditable research runs, and deterministic decision briefs.

Current verified slices include:

- Run-scoped execution using `thread_id`, `run_id`, and `segment_id`.
- Evidence preservation across completion, timeout, and cancellation paths.
- Application-owned `ResearchRun` and `EvidenceLedger` persistence.
- A restricted `talent-hiring-signal` profile with deterministic artifacts.
- A fixed-sample Talent benchmark whose P1A value gate passed.
- A default-disabled single-node SQLite durable HITL feasibility path whose
  13 durability and safety gates passed.

The canonical repository and technical identifier are
`decision-research-agent`. Runtime configuration, Tool Client usage, Docker
defaults, and `/health` service identity use that canonical identifier.

## Source Of Truth

Use this priority order:

1. Actual code, tests, migrations, configuration, and command output.
2. Accepted decisions in `docs/decisions/`.
3. Current contracts in `spec/`.
4. Current public specs and plans in `docs/superpowers/`.
5. Operations and evidence documents.
6. Issues, PR descriptions, historical plans, and external artifacts.

If sources conflict, report the conflict and follow current implementation
unless the task explicitly changes it. Do not silently apply an older plan.

`docs/evidence/run-log.md` is the truth source for partial-versus-complete
runtime evidence. A cited Evidence entry is not independently verified unless
its verification state explicitly says so.

## Read Only What The Change Needs

Start with `AGENTS.md`, `git status`, the affected code, and relevant tests.
Then read the smallest applicable set:

| Change | Additional reading |
|---|---|
| LangGraph, DeepAgents, model binding, structured output | `agent/main_agent.py`, `agent/profile_agents.py`, `agent/llm.py`, `langchain-dev-guide`, current official docs through Context7 |
| Run identity, persistence, concurrency | `docs/decisions/run-identity-boundaries.md` and affected repositories/tests |
| Evidence or finalization | `agent/run_result.py`, `api/task_finalizer.py`, lifecycle tests |
| Talent profile or benchmark | profile/contracts/artifact/review modules and benchmark tests |
| Durable review or HITL | `docs/operations/durable-hitl-feasibility.md`, gate report, affected review modules/tests |
| REST, WebSocket, Tool Client | `spec/api-contract.md`, `docs/AGENT_INTEGRATION.md`, contract tests |
| Frontend | `frontend/README.md`, affected API contract, current Vue code |
| Public metric or claim | producing command/artifact and its evidence boundary |

Do not load every listed document for an unrelated or local change. If a
document is missing or stale, inspect implementation and tests instead.

## Architecture Boundaries

- The application database is authoritative for research runs, evidence,
  review workflow, decisions, leases, resolution state, and artifact metadata.
- The LangGraph checkpointer stores review-gate execution position. It is not
  the business ledger.
- LangSmith is privacy-first diagnostic tracing. It does not decide business
  readiness, Evidence authority, or delivery.
- `thread_id` groups caller conversation and remains a compatibility identity.
  `run_id` owns one isolated execution. Do not mechanically rename them.
- Run-scoped workspace, SharedContext, tokens, telemetry, monitor routing, and
  search cache must not leak across concurrent runs.
- Timeout, cancellation, completion, and stale writers must use fenced atomic
  finalization without losing frozen Evidence.
- Talent execution stays limited to approved tools and declared Evidence. It
  must not gain upload or arbitrary filesystem access.
- Talent findings and claims require non-empty Evidence references resolving
  to the current run. Missing or invented references fail closed.
- Canonical Talent artifacts remain deterministic for equivalent accepted
  inputs.
- Durable HITL remains disabled by default. The current gate proves bounded
  single-node SQLite feasibility, not production readiness.
- Approval permits delivery but does not verify Evidence. Rejection blocks
  delivery and does not automatically start new research.
- Do not treat LangSmith as a ledger, introduce runtime Skills or Async
  Subagents, migrate Vue to React, or expand to multi-tenant infrastructure
  unless the task explicitly approves that scope.
- Do not rename compatibility identifiers, API paths, persisted identities,
  profile IDs, or benchmark IDs as incidental cleanup.

Changing these boundaries requires an ADR or an explicit update to an existing
decision document in the same PR.

## Risk-Based Execution

Use the lightest workflow that gives enough confidence.

### Level 1: Local Change

Examples: wording, comments, narrow tests, dependency metadata, local refactor
with no behavior change.

- Inspect the affected files.
- Make the smallest change.
- Run focused checks and `git diff --check`.
- No worktree, design document, TDD cycle, full suite, Autoplan, or GStack
  review is required unless the change reveals wider risk.

### Level 2: Behavior Change

Examples: bug fix, API behavior, persistence logic, Agent/tool behavior.

- Add a failing regression or behavior test first.
- Implement the smallest fix.
- Run focused tests, then broader tests matching the blast radius.
- Update affected documentation in the same change.
- Use an isolated worktree when the change is substantial or the checkout is
  not clean.

### Level 3: Contract Or Architecture Change

Examples: public API/schema, identity model, evidence lifecycle, durable HITL,
cross-module behavior, multiple planned PRs.

- Confirm or write an approved spec/plan.
- Use an isolated worktree and TDD.
- Update ADRs or public contracts.
- Run full relevant verification.
- Use Autoplan, `gstack-review`, documentation audit, or an independent second
  view only when their expected value justifies their cost or the user requests
  them.

Do not force small work through Level 3. If scope grows, explicitly raise the
level instead of silently expanding the process.

## Subagent Policy

Coding-workflow subagents are disabled by default because they add token,
context, and latency cost.

- Do not invoke implementation, research, testing, review, or documentation
  subagents.
- Do not invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`.
- Do not delegate merely because work could be parallelized.
- Do not automatically request a second-model review.
- Execute sequentially in the current Agent and keep context focused.

Use a subagent only when the user explicitly authorizes it for the current
task. Approval does not carry forward. Parallel read-only tool calls by the
current Agent are allowed and are not subagent delegation.

This policy governs development workflow. It does not remove the product's
existing runtime research sub-agent architecture.

## Working Rules

- Codex owns planning, implementation, testing, documentation, PR preparation,
  and final verification.
- Complete safe, obvious steps without asking the user to remember the process.
- Ask only when missing information creates meaningful implementation risk or
  an action requires authorization.
- Investigate root cause before fixing unexplained failures.
- Do not over-plan or continue expanding after acceptance criteria are met.
- Do not overwrite, revert, or delete unrelated user changes.
- Never claim a test, review, benchmark, build, push, PR, merge, or deployment
  without actual evidence.

## Testing And Verification

- Behavior changes require TDD; bug fixes require a regression test.
- Use unit tests for deterministic behavior, contract tests for schemas, and
  integration tests for persistence, concurrency, API, and worker boundaries.
- Mock remote providers in required CI. Keep real-provider and benchmark runs
  explicit and separate.
- Run focused tests during implementation. Run the full suite when shared
  behavior or multiple modules are affected.

Common commands:

```bash
python -m pytest -q

cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build

python scripts/durable_hitl_gate_runner.py \
  --output docs/evidence/durable-hitl-gate-report.json

git diff --check
```

Run the frontend build only when frontend or its contract is affected. Run the
durable HITL gate only when that contract is affected and Docker is available.
If a check cannot run, state the exact reason.

## Documentation

Ship documentation with the behavior it describes:

- Public API, Tool Client, configuration, or errors: update reference docs and
  contract tests.
- Architecture, identity, Evidence, or review lifecycle: update the relevant
  decision and explanation.
- Benchmark or public metric: update the evidence source and limits.
- Installation or operator workflow: update the relevant guide.
- Internal refactor with no behavior change: record `No documentation impact`
  in the PR.

Persist Superpowers specs and plans only for architecture, public contracts,
multi-module work, or multiple PRs. Use the Issue or PR body for small changes.
Long-lived architecture belongs in `docs/decisions/`.

Do not commit raw GStack artifacts, private planning notes, personal paths, or
job-search context.

## Git, Security, And Completion

- Inspect `git status` before editing.
- Use a short `codex/<scope>-<slug>` branch and route intended changes through
  a PR.
- Stage only intentional files; do not use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Do not push, create a PR, merge, release, deploy, install tools, or publish
  without explicit user authorization.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, cookies, `.env`, private configuration, or
  private source material.
- Treat uploads, model output, tool output, and external responses as
  untrusted.
- Do not expose absolute paths, credentials, raw exceptions, or stack traces in
  public responses.
- Public claims require repository-visible tests, benchmarks, or referenced
  evidence.

A task is complete when the requested behavior matches scope, appropriate
verification actually passed, required documentation is current, the diff is
clean and intentional, and remaining risks or skipped checks are reported.

PR descriptions default to Simplified Chinese and use a result-first structure:
`Summary`, `Completion`, `Verification`, then optional `Scope`,
`Risk / Impact`, migration, rollback, and documentation impact.
